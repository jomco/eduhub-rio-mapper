# Goal for project

Purpose 1: mapper function to transfer top-level OOAPI objects
to RIO objects (one directional). This works purely with clojure data
structures (does not make file IO or API calls).

RIO objects are ultimately serialized to XML.

OOAPI objects arrive as JSON.

This concerns the following top-level OOAPI objects:

- Education Specification

- Course / Program (with related Offerings)

We'll start with the EducationSpecification because this is it
simplest.

# Data flow (final app)

- Get OOAPI JSON via Edhuhub Gateway

- OOAPI JSON -> OOAPI Data (via standard json -> clojure reader)

- Validate OOAPI data with spec, error if not valid

- Get RIO Ids map for all relevant RIO resolver API objects.

- OOAPI Data + RIO IDs -> RIO Data (pure function)

- Validate RIO Data (for testing, in dev we use generative
  testing and then this could be disabled in prod)

- RIO Data serialization to RIO XML (perhaps via hiccup-style
  "between format")

- Validate RIO XML using XSD

- Post RIO XML to API# Implementation steps (mapper without API calls)

## Mapper of pure data

- Write down example of OOAPI data

- example of RIO Data equivalent of the above OOAPI Data

- create specs for OOAPI Data. Spec contains checks for required fields
  and types etc. The spec may be stricter than the OOAPI swagger
  definition if necessary for the translation (e.g. certain
  attributes may then be required for the mapper).

- create specs for RIO Data (clojure idiomatic, easy to spec)

- implementation mapper from `EducationSpecification` OOAPI Data to
  RIO Data, with tests

- RIO XML serialization of the above RIO Data

- Validate Rio XML with given XSDs

- implementation mapper from `Education` OOAPI Data to RIO Data, with
  tests.

- RIO XML serialization of the above RIO Data

- Validate Rio XML with given XSDs

If problems arise during the above that require adjustments
the APIs are needed, we will discuss this with Surf so that they can be implemented
adjustments can be scheduled. The aim is that adjustments are not made
more than 2 iterations of the specs are implemented. We have to do this
so batch and document well. How exactly should we look? In
We then continue working in the meantime (leave certain attributes out
consideration / simplifying, etc.), preferably with data that meets the requirements
existing specs.

## Api calls

- Implement test/mock APIs (OOAPI and Rio), find out how and what is
  necessary for the steps below. For example defining the OOAPI Client and Rio
  client as protocol, and making separate implementations for testing purposes.

- Make OOAPI API calls to collect data based on "path":
  setting url/id, type of root object (Education of
  EducationSpecification), root object id.

- Make RIO resolver API calls to translate OOAPI id to RIO id.

- Make RIO API calls to perform RIO XML CRUD actions.

Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable calls for all API calls.
retryable errors. This must be processed by the caller of the mapper function
become.

## Demo app

- Demo CLI app; given configuration and OOAPI path arguments it should be able to perform
- a mapping against the OOAPI and RIO APIs. Possibly with retries in case of errors.

## Create keystore

During development, keystore.jks and truststore.jks files are needed
in the root of the project. Don't add these to git! In order to generate the keystore, run:

```sh
sh dev/create-keystore.sh
```

To regenerate the truststore (already included in this repo), run:

```sh
sh dev/create-truststore.sh
```

## Configuration

The application is configured with environment variables. The following variables
must be set:

```
API_HOSTNAME                        Hostname for listing web API
API_PORT                            HTTP port for serving web API
CLIENTS_INFO_PATH                   CLients info config file
GATEWAY_PASSWORD                    OOAPI Gateway Password
GATEWAY_ROOT_URL                    OOAPI Gateway Root URL
GATEWAY_USER                        OOAPI Gateway Username
HTTP_MESSAGES                       Boolean; should all http traffic be logged? Defaults to false.
JOBS_MAX_RETRIES                    Max number of retries of a failed job
JOBS_RETRY_WAIT_MS                  Number of milliseconds to wait before retrying a failed job
KEYSTORE                            Path to keystore
KEYSTORE_ALIAS                      Key alias in keystore
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD                   Keystore password
REDIS_KEY_PREFIX                    Prefix for redis keys
REDIS_URI                           URI to redis
RIO_RETRY_ATTEMPTS_SECONDS          Comma-separated list of number of seconds to wait after each RIO retry.
RIO_READ_URL                        RIO Services Read URL
RIO_RECIPIENT_OIN                   Recipient OIN for RIO SOAP calls
RIO_UPDATE_URL                      RIO Services Update URL
STATUS_TTL_SEC                      Number of seconds hours to keep job status
SURF_CONEXT_CLIENT_ID               SurfCONEXT client id for Mapper service
SURF_CONEXT_CLIENT_SECRET           SurfCONEXT client secret for Mapper service
SURF_CONEXT_INTROSPECTION_ENDPOINT  SurfCONEXT introspection endpoint
TRUSTSTORE                          Path to trust-store
TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD                 Trust-store password
```

The `CLIENTS_INFO_PATH` should specify a json file with settings for client-id, schac-home and oin:

```json
{
  "clients": ""
  [{
    "client-id": "rio-mapper-dev.jomco.nl",
    "institution-schac-home": "demo06.test.surfeduhub.nl",
    "institution-oin": "0000000700025BE00000",
    "institution-name": "University of Uitgeest",
    "onderwijsbestuurscode": "123B321",
  },
  ...]
}
```

## Docker containers

The application consists of two parts: the *API* and the *Worker*. Both
components can be started from a single docker image
for which a [./Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is included. See for the
configuration options the [./CLI.md](CLI) documentation and note that
these containers both need access to the same *redis*
server.

Build the docker image with:

```sh
docker build -t eduhub-rio-mapper .
```

To run the API server:

```sh
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e API_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 \
  -e API_PORT=8888 \
  -v config:/config \
  --env-file config.env \
  eduhub-rio-mapper \
  serve-api
```

and to run the worker:

```sh
docker run \
  -v config:/config \
  --env-file config.env \
  eduhub-rio-mapper \
  worker
```

Notice that `config.env` is not included in the repo, and that the configuration files should be made 
available via a "volume" (see `-v` option).
