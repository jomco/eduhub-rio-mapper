  "Worker loop.

  It loops through list of queues and tries to acquire a lock for them
  to do work (this ensures jobs are run in order for a queue).  When
  the lock has been acquired it pops a job from the queue and runs it.
  If the job failed but can be restarted (see also `retryable?`), we
  waits `retry-wait-ms` and puts the job back in the front of the
  queue.

  Configuration takes several functions:

  - `queue-fn` a function which takes one argument, a job, and returns
    a queue name for that job.

  - `run-job-fn` a function which takes one argument, a job, it
    returns the result of the job.

  - `set-status-fn` a function which takes two or three arguments; a
    job, a status symbol and some extra data.

  - `error-fn` a function which takes one argument, the result of the
    job, and returns true when the job failed.

  - `retryable-fn` a function which takes one argument, the result of the
    job, and returns true when job failed but can be retried.

  - `jobs-counter-fn` a function which takes two arguments, a job and a job status,
    and updates the metrics related to the job status type. Also updates the metrics for the queues.
